Confidence gate is too strict
You scale confidences by 0.85 and then require ≥ 0.80. That means the raw LLM confidence must be ≥ 0.941 to pass (0.941 * 0.85 ≈ 0.80). You’ll drop most good tags. For MVP, don’t filter here—let the ensemble + prototype thresholds do the gating. Fix = set confidence_scale=1.0 and min_confidence=0.0.

Field name for ensemble
Your suggestions carry tag_id, but many downstream paths expect label_id. Normalize before combining to avoid silent misses. (If your combiner already handles tag_id, ignore this; otherwise map.)

Everything else looks fine: category prompts are clear, ID lists are validated against allowed_ids, synonyms parsing handles both string and list, and the parallel executor defends each category call.

Minimal patches
A) Keep all tags (no filtering) and clamp the score

In ReasoningScorer.__init__:

def __init__(self, model: str = "gpt-4o", min_confidence: float = 0.0, confidence_scale: float = 1.0):
    ...


In score_lecture(...), replace the filtering block with a no-drop pass-through:

formatted_suggestions = []
for sugg in raw_suggestions:
    # keep raw score; clamp to [0,1]
    calibrated = max(0.0, min(1.0, sugg['score']))
    formatted_suggestions.append({
        'tag_id': sugg['tag_id'],                # or map to label_id here if needed
        'tag_name_he': sugg['tag_name_he'],
        'score': calibrated,
        'rationale': sugg['rationale'],
        'category': sugg['category'],
        'model': f'category_reasoning:{self.model}'
    })


(This removes the >= self.min_confidence drop.)

B) (Optional) Map to label_id for the ensemble combiner

Right after building formatted_suggestions:

for s in formatted_suggestions:
    s['label_id'] = s.pop('tag_id')  # if your ensemble expects label_id


(If your ensemble_scorer already accepts tag_id, skip.)

Sanity checks (no code change)

Lecturer bio type: your category prompt expects a string bio; be sure callers pass text (not a dict). Your category builder already accepts Optional[str].

Time/out behavior: exceptions per category are caught and return an empty result, so one failed call won’t block the others. Good.

If you make those two tiny changes, Step 1 is good to go.
